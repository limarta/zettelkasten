We can define a measure on $\mathbb{R}$ by giving a Stieltjes measure function $F$ with the following properties:
- $F$ is non-decreasing
- $F$ is right continuous

We can associate a measure by defining for *intervals* the value $\mu((a,b])=F(b)-F(a)$.

**Theorem**
If $F$ is non-decreasing and right continuous, there is a unique measure $\mu$ that satisfies $\mu((a,b])=F(b)-F(a)$.

>[!proof]-
> First note that algebra generated by half open-half closed intervals consists of finite unions of intervals $(a,b]$. Let $A=\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^N (a_i,b_i]$. The measure $\mu$ can be extended to the algebra by defining a finite sum:
>$$\bar{\mu}(A)=\sum\limits_{i=1}^N \mu((a_i,b_i])$$
>We can verify that this extension $\bar{\mu}$ is valid....
>By [[Caratheodory's Extension Theorem]], we can extend $\bar{\mu}$ to the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $(a,b]$.

>[!question]
>Take a real-valued R.V. Since two distributions that have the same distribution function also have the same measure, is it possible to have two different random variables with the same induced measure or distribution function? Yes. Amir Dembo points to a different Skorokhod's representation.
