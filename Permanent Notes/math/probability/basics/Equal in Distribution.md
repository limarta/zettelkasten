This is the same concept as [[Equal in Law]].

We denote $X\mathrel{\stackrel{\mbox{D}}{=}}Y$ and say $X$ equals to $Y$ *in distribution* or *in law* if and only if their distributions are the same. 

Namely if $X$'s induced distribution $\mu_X$ is the same as $Y$'s induced distribution $\mu_Y$.

Note that if $X$ and $Y$ have the same measure, then their distribution *functions* are also equal. Moreover, by an [[Measure on R|lemma of Caratheodory's extension theorem]] on $\mathbb{R}$, we have the converse!

So in general, we can compare the distributions or the distribution **functions** (CDFs).
